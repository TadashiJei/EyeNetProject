# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

EyeNet is a comprehensive network monitoring and management system designed to provide real-time insights into network performance, security, and resource utilization. This document outlines the high-level architecture and key components of the system.

## System Components

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Modern React-based UI with server-side rendering
- Real-time dashboard with network metrics
- Interactive network topology visualization
- Department and user management interfaces

### Backend (Node.js)
- RESTful API endpoints for data access
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Authentication and authorization
- Data aggregation and processing

### Network Controllers
- OpenDaylight integration for SDN capabilities
- pfSense integration for firewall management
- MikroTik RouterOS integration for network device control
- Failover mechanisms for high availability

### Machine Learning Service
- Anomaly detection for network traffic
- Bandwidth usage prediction
- Traffic classification
- Resource optimization recommendations

### Database (MongoDB)
